            <h1 class="article-title">If I sell a property in India, why is TDS so high for NRIs?</h1>
        </header>
        <div class="article-hero"><img src="../images/10.webp" alt="Property TDS"></div>
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>If you're an NRI selling property in India, you might be shocked to find that the buyer is supposed to
                deduct a <strong>huge percentage of the sale price as TDS</strong>. For NRIs, the TDS on property sale
                can be 20% or 30% of the sale consideration – much higher than the 1% TDS that applies when a resident
                sells property.</p>
            <h2>🤔 Why So High?</h2>
            <p>When a resident sells property, the government only asks the buyer to withhold 1% because they trust that
                the seller, being in India, can be chased for any additional tax on the capital gain.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>But an NRI might leave the country or already be abroad, so collecting the tax later could be
                    difficult. Therefore, the law puts the onus on the buyer to deduct the full approximate tax at
                    source.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>📊 The TDS Rates</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Long-term asset</strong> (owned for more than 2 years): TDS is <strong>20%</strong> of the
                    sale price (plus surcharge and cess, roughly ~23%)</li>
                <li><strong>Short-term asset</strong> (owned for 2 years or less): TDS is <strong>30%</strong> of the
                    sale price</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: TDS is on total sale price, not just the gain portion, which is why often the TDS amount overshoots
                the actual tax obligation.</p>
            <h2>💡 Lower TDS Certificate</h2>
            <p>You can apply for a <strong>Lower/Nil TDS certificate</strong> before sale so the buyer deducts closer to
                your actual tax liability, not on the full sale value. This is especially helpful for long-term assets
                with significant indexed cost.</p>
            <p>After sale, file your ITR to compute indexed gains and claim refund if TDS was over-withheld.</p>
