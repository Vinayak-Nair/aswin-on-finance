        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Investing in Indian stocks as a UAE-based NRI is possible, but it requires a special account setup. When
                you move abroad, you can't use your old resident trading account (like a standard Zerodha or Groww
                account) without modifications. In fact, platforms such as Groww currently do not support NRI
                investments at all. This means you'll need to shift to a broker that offers NRI services.</p>

            <p>For example, <strong>Zerodha</strong> – a popular Indian broker – does allow NRIs to trade, but you must
                open a dedicated NRI demat/trading account with them.</p>

            <h2>📋 Here's how the process generally works:</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>First</strong>, you should have an NRE or NRO bank account.</li>
                <li>You need to have your <strong>PAN Card</strong> and <strong>Passport</strong> with you.</li>
                <li>There needs to be an <strong>address proof</strong> – current residence address proof.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> As an NRI, you can only do delivery-based stock trades (buy and sell
                    stocks; intraday trading is not allowed).</p>
            </div>

            <p>If you were using Groww or a similar platform that doesn't cater to NRIs, you'll need to move your
                holdings out – for instance, transfer your shares to a new NRI demat or sell and reinvest via your NRI
                account. (We can help with that.)</p>

            <h2>🏦 The India-side Setup</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>You generally need an <strong>NRI Demat + Trading account</strong> with a broker that supports NRIs.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Funding routes:</strong> NRE-PIS (repatriable) or NRO (often non-PIS / limited
                    repatriation); your bank/broker will tell you which applies.</li>
                <li><strong>PIS</strong> is an RBI scheme used for NRI equity investing; brokers like Zerodha list
                    supported PIS banks and onboarding steps.</li>
                <li>Expect extra KYC + FATCA/CRS self-certifications.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>⚠️ Important Reminders</h2>

            <p>Once done, you can continue investing in Indian stocks from the UAE, fully legally and online. Remember,
                <strong>don't continue using your old resident demat/trading account</strong> after you become an NRI,
                as that violates regulations and could lead to penalties.
            </p>

            <h3>Practical Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Most Indian brokers require an NRI demat+trading account and an NRE/NRO bank account link.</li>
                <li><strong>Repatriation:</strong> NRE route is typically repatriable; NRO route is usually within the
                    USD 1m/year facility for outward remittance.</li>
                <li>Expect longer onboarding (courier/notarization) and extra KYC.</li>
                <li>Broker-specific: some allow equity via NRE-PIS and derivatives via NRO Non-PIS; check your broker's
                    NRI rules.</li>
            </ul>
