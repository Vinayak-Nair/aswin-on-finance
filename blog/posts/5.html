                abroad?</h1>
        </header>

        <div class="article-hero">
            <img src="../images/5.webp" alt="Tax-Free FD Interest">
        </div>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p><strong>Interest earned on NRE fixed deposits (and NRE savings accounts) is completely tax-free in
                    India.</strong> This tax exemption is actually written into the Indian Income Tax law (Section
                10(4)(ii)) – as long as you're an NRI and you earned that interest in an NRE account, it's not taxable
                in India.</p>

            <p>Banks also do not deduct TDS on NRE interest, since it's exempt. So, a big advantage of NRE FDs is that
                you get the full interest without any cut.</p>

            <h2>🇦🇪 What About Reporting in UAE?</h2>

            <p>Since you are in the UAE, the UAE does not levy any income tax on individuals. There's no personal income
                tax return filing for UAE residents in general (as of today). Therefore, you typically do not need to
                report bank interest from anywhere for UAE tax purposes, because there is no such tax.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Double Win:</strong> Your NRE FD interest is tax-free on both ends – India exempts it, and
                    UAE doesn't tax it either. If you're getting 7% interest on an NRE FD, you actually net 7%!</p>
            </div>

            <h2>🌍 If You Move to Another Country</h2>

            <p>That said, if you were to relocate to a country that taxes global income (like the US, UK, Canada, etc.),
                you would have to report the NRE interest in that country's tax return (because those countries tax
                residents on worldwide income). The Indian exemption would still hold in India, but you might owe tax in
                your new country.</p>

            <h2>📝 Record Keeping</h2>

            <p>Although no tax reporting is needed in UAE, some NRIs still keep records of their NRE interest for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Financial planning purposes</li>
                <li>Bank compliance (banks may ask for a self-declaration of being NRI for continued NRE status)</li>
                <li>Confirming only foreign funds go into NRE</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Just ensure you maintain your NRI status; if you lose NRI status (say you
                move back to India or stay too long), the account might need to be converted and the interest would
                become taxable at that point.</p>
