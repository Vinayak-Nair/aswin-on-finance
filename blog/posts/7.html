            <h2>📅 Practical Example</h2>
            <p>You live in Dubai but in 2025 you decided to spend April through August in India (5 months ~ 153 days).
                You have some bank interest and maybe minor rent income in India, nowhere near ₹15 lakhs.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> You stayed under 182 days, so you're still NRI for FY 2025-26. No change in
                    tax status; you'll be taxed only on Indian income, not your global income.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>⚠️ The Tipping Point</h2>
            <p>Now, say you stretched to a full 6 months April through September (about <strong>184 days</strong>) – now
                you've crossed the 182-day mark, so for FY 2025-26 you'd become an <strong>Indian resident for
                    tax</strong>.</p>
            <p>This would mean the Indian taxman can tax your worldwide income. And if that happens while you're also
                paying no tax in UAE, you'd potentially face Indian tax on your UAE income.</p>
            <h2>📋 Key Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>5 months is generally okay</strong> (likely still NRI)</li>
                <li><strong>6 months is the tipping point</strong> – try not to exceed 182 days</li>
                <li>If you're close to 182 days, even a small extension can flip residency for the whole year</li>
                <li>Many NRIs keep it well under 182 days to avoid even borderline cases</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you anticipate needing longer stays (perhaps for family or work reasons in India), consult a tax
                advisor to navigate the RNOR and DTAA aspects.</p>
