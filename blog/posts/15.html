        <div class="article-content">
            <p><strong>FATCA</strong> stands for Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and <strong>CRS</strong> stands for
                Common Reporting Standard. These are international information-sharing regulations aimed at preventing
                tax evasion.</p>
            <h2>🇺🇸 What is FATCA?</h2>
            <p>FATCA is a U.S. law (enacted in 2010) that requires financial institutions around the world to report
                accounts held by U.S. citizens or residents to the U.S. IRS. If you're a U.S. Person, FATCA wants to
                know if you have money in an Indian bank.</p>
            <h2>🌍 What is CRS?</h2>
            <p>CRS is a global standard by the OECD. Over 100 countries have adopted CRS. Under CRS, financial
                institutions identify customers' tax residencies and report financial account details to relevant
                jurisdictions. It's like a multilateral version of FATCA.</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Why banks ask:</strong> Banks must collect information about your tax residency to comply
                    with reporting obligations. Each year, they report account details of foreign residents to local tax
                    authorities.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>📋 What You Need to Provide</h2>
            <p>When opening an account as an NRI, you'll fill a FATCA/CRS declaration form asking:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are you a tax resident of any country other than India?</li>
                <li>If yes, provide country name and Tax ID number</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a UAE NRI, you'll declare UAE as your country of tax residence (even though UAE has no income tax, for
                CRS purposes you are still a resident of UAE).</p>
