            <p><strong>No, India does not tax the act of remitting foreign-earned money into India.</strong> If you are
                an NRI sending your UAE salary or income back to India, that remittance itself is not considered income
                in India and thus not taxable.</p>

            <p>For example, if you transfer money from your UAE bank to your Indian NRE account, Indian tax authorities
                treat it as transfer of your own foreign earnings, not as income generated in India. India taxes NRIs
                only on income that is "earned or accrued" in India, like rental income from an Indian property,
                interest on an Indian bank account, capital gains from Indian investments, etc.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Simply put:</strong> Your hard-earned dirhams converted to rupees don't get taxed when they
                    hit your Indian account.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>🌍 The Double Taxation Advantage</h2>

            <p>It's worth noting that the <strong>India–UAE Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA)</strong> ensures
                you won't be taxed twice on the same income. In practice, since the UAE has 0% personal income tax, your
                foreign income is not taxed in the UAE at all, and India doesn't tax it either if you're a non-resident.
                This is a double win.</p>

            <h2>⚠️ Gift Tax Considerations</h2>

            <p>However, be cautious if you send money as a gift to someone in India:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>While remittances to your own accounts are fine, large <strong>gifts to non-relatives</strong> (over
                    ₹50,000 in a year) could be taxable in the hands of the recipient in India.</li>
                <li><strong>Gifts to close relatives</strong> (spouse, parents, siblings, etc.) are exempt from Indian
                    gift tax, so there's no issue there.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>📋 Practical Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>India doesn't tax the transfer itself; the receiver's tax depends on whether the sender is a
                    'relative'.</li>
                <li>Keep a simple 'gift note' (date, amount, relationship, purpose) + bank proofs to answer future
                    bank/ITD queries.</li>
                <li>Keep a paper trail (remittance receipts + relationship proof).</li>
            </ul>
