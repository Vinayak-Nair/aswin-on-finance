<div class="article-summary"
    style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f0f9ff 0%, #e0f2fe 100%); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 12px; margin-bottom: 0.75rem; border-left: 4px solid #0ea5e9;">
    <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #0369a1;">📋 Quick Summary</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>If money is earned in India, invested in India, or sent from India, the
            Union Budget affects it.</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Budget 2026 is one of the more meaningful budgets for NRIs in recent years. It
        simplifies processes, offers a chance to clean up past mistakes with foreign assets, and opens more doors for
        investing in India.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="property-tds">1. Selling Property in India as an NRI: TAN Headache Removed</h2>
<h3>Quick Background: What is TDS and TAN?</h3>
<p><strong>TDS (Tax Deducted at Source):</strong> When someone buys property from an NRI, they must cut some tax from
    the amount they pay and deposit it with the government on the seller's behalf.</p>
<p><strong>TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number):</strong> A special number separate from PAN, needed if a
    person is deducting TDS in many situations.</p>
<h3>Old Rule (Before Budget 2026)</h3>
<p>If a resident individual bought property from an NRI seller, the buyer had to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Apply for a TAN (separate from PAN)</li>
    <li>Deduct TDS from the sale consideration</li>
    <li>Deposit that TDS using TAN</li>
    <li>File TAN-based TDS returns and comply with all related rules</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This created problems:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Most homebuyers only do property transactions once or twice in life, but still had to understand TAN, apply for
        it, and handle extra forms and deadlines</li>
    <li>Many buyers were scared of "NRI seller = heavy compliance" and either delayed the deal or backed out to find a
        resident seller instead</li>
</ul>
<h3>New Rule After Budget 2026</h3>
<div class="highlight-box"
    style="background: #ecfdf5; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 10px; border-left: 4px solid #10b981; margin: 0.75rem 0;">
    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>✅ Budget 2026 removes the TAN requirement for such buyers.</strong></p>
    <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;">The buyer will use PAN only, deduct TDS at the same applicable rate as before, and
        deposit TDS via a simple PAN-based challan.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Important points:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>TDS itself is still required. Only the procedure and compliance burden have been simplified.</li>
    <li>TDS rates on NRI property sales are not reduced in this change.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Simple Example</h3>
<p>Imagine an NRI is selling a flat in Bengaluru for ₹1.5 crore. The buyer is a salaried person based in India.</p>
<table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;">
    <thead>
        <tr style="background: #f3f4f6;">
            <th style="padding: 0.75rem; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">Before Budget 2026</th>
            <th style="padding: 0.75rem; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">After Budget 2026</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 0.75rem; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">Apply for TAN → wait days or weeks</td>
            <td style="padding: 0.75rem; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">Uses PAN only (no TAN needed)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 0.75rem; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">Understand TAN-based TDS returns</td>
            <td style="padding: 0.75rem; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">Deducts the required TDS</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 0.75rem; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">Often pay a CA to handle the process</td>
            <td style="padding: 0.75rem; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">Deposits TDS using simple PAN-based challan</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<h3>Why This Matters to NRIs</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Less friction in selling property</li>
    <li>Fewer excuses from buyers like "NRI seller means too much headache"</li>
    <li>Better chance of smoother transactions, timely payments, and proper TDS credit appearing in your Form 26AS</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This is a process relief, not a tax rate benefit—but in property deals, process pain is often as big as the tax
        itself.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="foreign-asset-disclosure">2. One-Time 6-Month Window to Disclose Foreign Assets and Income</h2>
<p>This is crucial for NRIs and returning NRIs who:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Opened foreign bank accounts as students</li>
    <li>Received RSUs/ESOPs in foreign companies</li>
    <li>Invested in foreign funds or insurance products</li>
    <li>Are not 100% sure if everything was correctly disclosed in Indian tax returns</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Was the Earlier Fear?</h3>
<p>India has a tough law: the <strong>Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) Act</strong>.</p>
<p>If a person has foreign assets or income and fails to properly disclose them in Indian returns:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Heavy penalties</li>
    <li>In extreme cases, prosecution (criminal cases)</li>
</ul>
<p>This especially trapped:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Students and young professionals who forgot about small foreign accounts</li>
    <li>Tech employees who did not fully understand disclosure rules for ESOPs/RSUs</li>
    <li>Returning NRIs who assumed "foreign accounts are small, no one cares"</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Budget 2026 Introduces</h3>
<div class="highlight-box"
    style="background: #fef3c7; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 10px; border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b; margin: 0.75rem 0;">
    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>🔔 Budget 2026 provides a one-time, 6-month disclosure window for foreign income and
            assets.</strong></p>
</div>
<h4>Category A: Undisclosed Foreign Income & Assets up to ₹1 Crore</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Case:</strong> The foreign asset or income was never disclosed at all in any return</li>
    <li><strong>Condition:</strong> Total value up to ₹1 crore</li>
    <li><strong>Cost to regularise:</strong> 30% tax + 30% penalty = <strong>60% total outgo</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Full immunity from prosecution under the Black Money Act</li>
</ul>
<h4>Category B: Asset Not Reported, but Income Already Taxed (up to ₹5 Crore)</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Case:</strong> The income from the asset was included in the Indian return, but the asset itself was not
        shown in Schedule FA (foreign asset schedule)</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Foreign salary was taxed in India, but the foreign bank account holding that salary
        balance was not reported</li>
    <li><strong>Limit:</strong> Total foreign assets up to ₹5 crore</li>
    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> <strong>₹1 lakh flat fee</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Relief from penalty and prosecution for this kind of non-reporting</li>
</ul>
<h4>Relief for Very Small Foreign Assets</h4>
<p>Very small foreign movable assets (non-immovable) up to around ₹20 lakh are effectively immune from prosecution,
    recognising that small balances are often missed accidentally.</p>
<h3>Who Should Seriously Look at This?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Returning NRIs with old foreign bank accounts that were never declared</li>
    <li>Residents who earlier worked abroad and have small brokerage accounts, ESOP/RSU holdings, or dormant foreign
        accounts</li>
    <li>Anyone who realises: "There is something abroad; it is not properly shown in Schedule FA; better to clean it up
        while there is an official window"</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This scheme is not cheap (especially Category A), but it removes the fear of future Black Money Act action, which
        can be far more painful.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="foreign-income-exemption">3. 5-Year Tax Exemption on Foreign Income for Certain Returning/Visiting NRIs</h2>
<h3>Normal Residency Rule (Super Simplified)</h3>
<p>Under regular rules, if a person stays in India for 182 days or more in a financial year, they may become a resident
    for tax purposes. Once resident, India can tax global income (not just Indian income).</p>
<p>For NRIs who work across countries, this is scary: taking a long assignment in India could mean salary from foreign
    employers, overseas interest/dividends, all become taxable in India too.</p>
<h3>What Budget 2026 Does</h3>
<div class="highlight-box"
    style="background: #ede9fe; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 10px; border-left: 4px solid #8b5cf6; margin: 0.75rem 0;">
    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>🌍 Special carve-out for certain skilled NRIs and foreign professionals:</strong></p>
    <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;">For 5 years from the date of taking up work in India, their foreign income will be
        exempt from Indian tax, even if they satisfy residency conditions.</p>
</div>
<h4>Conditions (Broadly):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The person should have been non-resident for at least 5 continuous years before coming to India</li>
    <li>They come to India to work under a government-notified scheme, project, or sector (likely high-tech, strategic,
        or priority areas)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Important Clarifications:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>This is <strong>not a blanket benefit</strong> for every NRI who comes back</li>
    <li>Applies only to people working on specific, notified projects/sectors</li>
    <li>Only foreign income gets exempt; income sourced in India (salary paid in India, rent from Indian property,
        interest from NRO, etc.) will still be taxable</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why This is Important for NRIs</h3>
<p>Encourages highly skilled NRIs to take up longer projects in India and contribute expertise here—without fear that
    all foreign savings and income will suddenly face Indian tax.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="investment-limits">4. NRIs and Other Overseas Individuals Can Own More of Indian Companies</h2>
<h3>Some Terminology</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>NRI / OCI:</strong> Non-Resident Indian / Overseas Citizen of India</li>
    <li><strong>PROI (Person Resident Outside India):</strong> Anyone who is not a resident in India – includes NRIs,
        OCIs, and foreign nationals</li>
    <li><strong>PIS (Portfolio Investment Scheme):</strong> A route for NRIs to directly buy and sell shares of Indian
        companies through designated banks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Old Rules (Simplified)</h3>
<p>For investments via the NRI portfolio route:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Individual limit</strong> for one NRI in one company: Typically <strong>5%</strong> of the paid-up
        capital</li>
    <li><strong>Aggregate limit</strong> for all NRIs/OCIs together: Default <strong>10%</strong> (could be raised to
        24% by shareholder approval)</li>
</ul>
<h3>New Rules in Budget 2026</h3>
<table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;">

            <th style="padding: 0.75rem; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">After Budget 2026</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 0.75rem; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">Individual limit per company</td>
            <td style="padding: 0.75rem; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">5%</td>
            <td style="padding: 0.75rem; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;"><strong>10%</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 0.75rem; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">Aggregate limit (all non-residents)</td>
            <td style="padding: 0.75rem; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;">10% (default)</td>
            <td style="padding: 0.75rem; border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;"><strong>24%</strong> (default)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Additional changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>PIS-like portfolio investment access is now more clearly available not only to NRIs/OCIs but to wider PROIs</li>
    <li>PROIs can more easily access Portfolio Management Services (PMS) in India without always needing complex FPI
        registrations</li>
</ul>
<h3>What This Means in Plain Language</h3>
<p>NRIs who like to pick Indian stocks can build larger positions in favourite companies before hitting regulatory caps.
    This signals that India wants deeper participation from the diaspora and global investors—more capital into Indian
    markets, but via clean, regulated channels.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="new-income-tax-act">5. New Income Tax Act 2025: Clearer "Special Regime" for NRIs</h2>
<h3>Big Picture: A New Tax Law</h3>
<p>India is replacing the old Income-tax Act, 1961 with a brand-new <strong>Income Tax Act, 2025</strong>, which will
    apply from <strong>1 April 2026</strong> (i.e., from FY 2026–27).</p>
<p>NRIs are directly affected because the new Act reorganises all the special rules, rates, and benefits applicable to
    non-residents.</p>
<h3>What Changes for NRIs?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>There is a "Special Tax Regime" for NRIs that was earlier scattered across many sections; now it is consolidated
        and made more systematic</li>
    <li>Budget 2026 mainly focuses on clarity and simplification, not on slashing rates</li>
    <li>Tries to reduce disputes by writing clearer definitions and rules</li>
</ul>
<h3>Old vs New (Conceptually)</h3>
<table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;">
    <thead>
        <tr style="background: #f3f4f6;">

<p><em>From FY 2026–27, NRIs do not necessarily get lower tax rates, but the rules become more organised and easier to
        understand.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="revised-return">6. More Time to Fix Mistakes in Tax Returns (Including NRI Returns)</h2>
<h3>Old Timelines</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Filing due date:</strong> Most salaried and simple-income taxpayers: 31 July</li>
    <li><strong>Revised return deadline:</strong> Up to 31 December of the same assessment year</li>
</ul>
<p>For NRIs, this was tight because they may wait for foreign tax residency certificates, final foreign tax documents,
    and may discover late that Schedule FA is incomplete or foreign tax credit computations need correction.</p>
<h3>New Rules in Budget 2026</h3>
<div class="highlight-box"
    style="background: #ecfdf5; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 10px; border-left: 4px solid #10b981; margin: 0.75rem 0;">
    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>📅 Revised return deadline extended from 31 December to 31 March</strong> of the
        assessment year.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0;">A small fee (e.g., ₹1,000 or ₹5,000 based on income) applies if filed after 31
        December—but it's still far better than being stuck with a wrong original return.</p>
</div>
<h3>Why This Helps NRIs</h3>
<ul>
    <li>More time to collect foreign documents and reconcile global income</li>
    <li>Correct missing or wrong details in Schedule FA</li>
    <li>Properly claim foreign tax credit once foreign returns are finalised</li>
</ul>
<p>For many NRIs, life is spread across time zones and financial years; this extra 3-month buffer can make the
    difference between smooth compliance vs chronic errors and notices.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">7. Putting It All Together: What is the Overall Message for NRIs?</h2>
<p>Looking at all the changes together, Budget 2026 sends a clear signal to NRIs:</p>
<div style="background: #f8fafc; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 12px; margin: 0.75rem 0;">
    <h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: #0f172a;">🟢 "Genuine NRIs should find it easier to do things right."</h4>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
        <li>No TAN needed for buyers when purchasing property from NRIs</li>
        <li>Longer time to correct returns</li>
        <li>Clearer, more organised law under the new Income Tax Act 2025</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 style="color: #0f172a;">🟡 "Serious mistakes on foreign assets can be fixed – but only now, and not cheaply."
    </h4>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
        <li>A 6-month one-time window to disclose foreign income/assets up to ₹1 crore (or ₹5 crore for the second
            category) with tax + penalty/fee, in exchange for immunity</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 style="color: #0f172a;">🔵 "India wants more NRI and foreign capital in markets and more talent on the ground."
    </h4>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li>Higher shareholding limits for NRIs/PROIs in listed companies</li>
        <li>Easier PMS access</li>
        <li>5-year foreign income exemption for eligible professionals working on notified projects</li>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">📋 Action Items Based on Your Situation</h3>
    <h4>✅ Planning to sell property in India?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Explain to the buyer that no TAN is needed now, just PAN-based TDS compliance</li>
        <li>Still discuss with a CA about correct TDS rate and capital gains</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>✅ Old foreign assets or incomes not perfectly disclosed?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Consider talking to a CA about the 6-month disclosure scheme to decide whether to use it</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>✅ Considering a medium-term move to India for a special project?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>If the role fits government-notified sectors, explore whether the 5-year foreign income exemption can apply
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>✅ Active in Indian stock markets as an NRI?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Revisit concentration limits and strategy, since ownership caps have gone up</li>
    </ul>
