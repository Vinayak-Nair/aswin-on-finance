        <div class="article-content">
            <p>The <strong>182-day rule</strong> is the key threshold. As a basic rule under Indian Income Tax law, you
                are considered a resident of India (and thus lose NRI status) if you are in India for <strong>182 days
                    or more</strong> in a financial year (April 1 – March 31).</p>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>Staying under 182 days in a given financial year generally means you remain an NRI for that year.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>⚠️ 120-Day Rule for High Earners</h2>
            <p>Recently, India introduced a tweak. If you are an Indian citizen or Person of Indian Origin (PIO) who
                comes to visit India and your <strong>Indian-sourced income exceeds ₹15 lakh</strong> in that year, then
                the threshold is reduced to <strong>120 days</strong>.</p>
            <p>For example, suppose you have rental and other incomes in India totaling ₹20 lakh in a year – if you
                spend 5 months (150 days) in India that year, this rule could trigger residency because you crossed 120
                days and have >₹15 lakh Indian income.</p>
            <h2>📊 60-Day Rule</h2>
            <p>The tax law also says an individual is resident if they spend at least 60 days in India in that year and
                365 days in the preceding 4 years. However, for Indian citizens and PIOs, this 60-day criterion is
                relaxed to 182 days in many cases.</p>
            <h2>📋 Practical Guidelines</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Most UAE NRIs:</strong> You can spend about 6 months in India each year without changing
                    your NRI tax status.</li>
                <li>Count days in the Indian financial year (Apr 1–Mar 31) using entry/exit dates.</li>
                <li>Keep copies of tickets/immigration stamps as proof.</li>
                <li>If you have substantial Indian passive income, try to stay under 120 days.</li>
            </ul>
