 The shape of Pringles, the sabbatical wonder. In the 1950s, potato chips were getting a lot of complaints from customers. It was getting broken and there was too much air in the packet. Seeing an opportunity, PNG asked scientists Fred Bauer to find a solution. With his expertise in chemistry and maths, he got to work and invented a potato chips that looked like it was. In geometry, this shape was called a hyperbolic paraboloid and it is really special. The unique shape makes the chips sturdy and it can be transported without breaking and it can be stacked in a cylindrical container without air inside it. Also this shape is aerodynamic like a formula word car so that it does not fly off the production belt like other chips. In short they could reduce wastage and solve customer problems in one go. And guess what? The cylindrical vacuum tip was also patented by friend bar. In a market where broken chips was the only option, fingers understood the pain point and created the perfect solution. That too with some mathematical brilliance.
